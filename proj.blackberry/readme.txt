Payment Service - Support in-app purchases

========================================================================
Sample Description:

 The Payment Service Sample is an application that is designed to show you how
 to support purchase requests in your applications using the Payment Service,
 which is a service in the BlackBerry Platform Services library. You can
 register digital goods in the vendor portal for BlackBerry App World and allow
 users to purchase these digital goods in your applications.

 When you run the application it starts with the simulation of a purchase
 already initiated.  Once you're done, you can simulate another purchase by 
 swiping down from the top of the screen. The simulated purchase request is 
 performed in local mode, meaning that no information is sent to the Payment 
 Service server and a simulated purchase response is received.
